# Graduation Scraper

## About

NDSU Releases a list every fall and spring semester (and sometimes summer) of the students who have graduated for that semester. This program collects that information into one sqlite table for easier querying, from 2012 to 2020. Accuracy isn't assured to do release consent (maybe) and also my trash code.
